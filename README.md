# CLANG

Clang is an all in one discord bot witten with pycord, inspired by Valkyrja. Handles moderation, tickets, logging, notes, and fun commands.

Clang is fully modular, extensible extendable, and customizable with its functionality to dynamically load plugins.

Clang is a skull kept alive by eldritch magic. It screams and talks nonsense.

Clang also comes built in with its own custom mock shell for configuration and management.
